# TSP with genetic algorithm

<b>Overview of genetic algorithm</b><br>
GA is a systematic randomized approach to find optimal solution. It is inspired from natural evolution stated by Charles Darwin. More details about GA and this implementation is in medium article : <br>
<br>

<b>GA methods used in this implementation</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Permutation encoding</li>
<li>Population size is arbitrary</li>
<li>Fitness function is the cost of the path, and it must be minimized</li>
<li>Roulette wheel selection</li>
<li>Order based crossover</li>
<li>Interchange mutation</li>
<li>Max fit survives [Least fitness value survives]</li>
<li>We iterate till k generations, “k” is arbitrary [Termination condition]</li>
</ul>
